#### Tire pressure

Regularly check your tire pressure and tread depth: Properly inflated tires can improve your car's fuel efficiency and prolong tire life. 
Additionally, worn-out tires can compromise your car's safety, so it's important to replace them when necessary.

#### Cleanliness
Keep your car clean: Regularly washing your car can help protect the paint and prevent rust from forming. Cleaning the inside of your car can also prevent the buildup of dirt and bacteria.

#### Oil change
Change your oil and oil filter regularly: This is one of the most important things you can do to keep your car running smoothly. Check your owner's manual for recommended oil change intervals.

#### Maintenance
Keep up with routine maintenance: Regular maintenance, such as replacing filters and fluids, can help prevent more costly repairs down the line.

#### Fuel
Use the right fuel: Make sure you're using the right type of fuel for your car. Check your owner's manual for recommendations.

#### Parking
Park in a covered or shaded area: Exposure to the elements can cause damage to your car over time, so try to park in a covered or shaded area when possible.

#### Warnings
Pay attention to warning lights: If a warning light comes on, don't ignore it. Get it checked out by a professional as soon as possible.

#### Overloading
Don't overload your car: Overloading your car can put extra strain on the engine and suspension, leading to problems down the line.

#### Driving
Drive carefully: Aggressive driving, such as speeding and rapid acceleration, can cause unnecessary wear and tear on your car. Drive carefully to prolong the life of your vehicle.

#### Inspection
Have a professional inspect your car regularly: A professional mechanic can catch potential problems before they turn into major repairs, so make sure to have your car inspected regularly.
